# Domain Checker

Domain Checker is a simple tool that allows you to check the availability of a domain name. It helps you quickly determine whether a domain name is already registered or available for purchase.

## Features

- **Check Domain Availability**: Enter a domain name, and the tool will check if it is available.
- **Support for Multiple TLDs**: The tool can check domains with various top-level domains (TLDs) like `.com`, `.net`, `.org`, and more.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.0.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Karthikkk-24/DomainChecker.git
    cd domain-checker
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    If you're using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Or, if you're using yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Run the application:**

    If you're using npm:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Or, if you're using yarn:

    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application in action.

### How It Works

1. **Enter a Domain Name**: Type the domain name you want to check into the input field.
2. **Check Availability**: The tool will query the domain registry and let you know if the domain is available or already taken.
3. **Results**: You will receive a message indicating whether the domain is available or not.
